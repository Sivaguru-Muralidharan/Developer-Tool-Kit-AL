# What is a Commit?
Let us assume that you are working in Notepad, and you write a couple of lines of text. During this time, the text is stored in RAM and is not written to the Primary Storage Device. When all text is written, to permanently save the text, the Save Key is pressed. This moves all text from RAM to the Primary Storage. This is called a Commit in the Git Universe.
> The Movement of the Code from the current working directory to the repository is called a commit.
