# Commit Code
## Why Code is Committed?
* As a Rule of Thumb, When working with Multiple Developers on a Project or Support Ticket, End of Day Commit `EODC` should be followed.
* Regardless of the status of Development, All code must be committed to the Branch to avoid Loss of Code.
## How to Commit Code?
* Committing Code follows some standard Procedures which must be followed to ensure a stable and Developer Friendly Repository
* A Commit Message is the most important part of committing. The Message can handle Multiple Lines, but only the First line is displayed as a Title in Azure DevOps and GitHub.
* Keep the limit for max characters typed in a single line to 50 Characters.
* Do not Bulk Commit Code as it may lead to confusing Commit Messages and will Make Rolling back on a Commit more difficult.
